The park feeds two of the world’s largest rivers, the Congo and the Nile, and provides a significant portion of Rwanda’s fresh water. Over 1,100 recorded plant species, 345 bird species and 85 known mammal species, including 13 of Africa’s primates – notably, chimpanzee, Ruwenzori black-and-white colobus and L’Hoest’s monkeys – are found in this exceptional landscape."
